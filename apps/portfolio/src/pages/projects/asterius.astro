				Asterius is a project I built to bring the{" "}

				pathfinding algorithm to life through visualization. As someone who has been captivated by video games since childhood, I&apos;ve always been intrigued by
				the mechanics of how characters and objects navigate their environments.

			<h2>Generating the Maze</h2>

			<p>Generating an unbiased, random maze can be challenging. Thankfully, there is an algorithm that is good for this specific task.</p>
			<p>
				Wilson&apos;s algorithm uses <Link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop-erased_random_walk" variant="external">Loop-erased random walks</Link> to generate
				a uniform spanning tree â€” an unbiased sample of all possible spanning trees. Most other maze generation algorithms, such as Prim&apos;s, random traversal
				and randomized depth-first traversal, do not have this beautiful property.
