				Hi, <span class="animate-waving-hand">ðŸ‘‹</span> I&apos;m <span class="text-primary font-semibold text-lg md:text-xl">Corbin Murray</span>. I am a <span
					class="font-bold">software engineer</span
				> who loves turning big ideas into practical, working solutions.
			</p>
			<p>
				Welcome to my small slice of the internet, where I share the projects I&apos;ve built, the things I&apos;ve learned, and the occasional wild experiment.
				Like any good garden, it&apos;s a work in progress â€” growing, evolving, and sometimes sprouting unexpected ideas. Take a look around, and maybe
				you&apos;ll find something inspiring â€” or at least worth chatting about!

			<p>
				Time to dig into the good stuff â€” as a software engineer passionate about creating innovative solutions and tackling complex challenges. My professional
				interests include backend development, event-driven architecture, and building systems that are both scalable and efficient. I thrive in collaborative
				environments where creativity meets purpose, and I love working with modern tech stacks to bring ideas to life.

				When I&apos;m not coding, you&apos;ll often find me spending time with my wife and our two dogs, Pretzel and Ink. I&apos;m also a huge fan of
				weightlifting, soccer, and the occasional DIY project. Whether it&apos;s exploring local coffee shops, getting lost in nature, or diving into a good
				video game, I try to find balance between my professional and personal passions.

				This site is a reflection of all those facets â€” my love for software development, my curiosity for learning, and the things that make life fun along the
				way.
