					Time to dig into the good stuff -- as a software engineer passionate about creating innovative solutions and tackling complex challenges. My
					professional interests include backend development, event-driven architecture, and building systems that are both scalable and efficient. I thrive in
					collaborative environments where creativity meets purpose, and I love working with modern tech stacks to bring ideas to life.

					When I&apos;m not coding, you&apos;ll often find me spending time with my wife and our two dogs, Pretzel and Ink. I&apos;m also a huge fan of
					weightlifting, soccer, and the occasional DIY project. Whether it&apos;s exploring local coffee shops, getting lost in nature, or diving into a good
					video game, I try to find balance between my professional and personal passions.

					This site is a reflection of all those facetsâ€”my love for software development, my curiosity for learning, and the things that make life fun along the
					way.
